# **App Name**: ACM Cryptic Coven

## Core Features:

- Mystical Planchette Interface: Fluid animated planchette that glides between keys with realistic physics-based movement, trailing ethereal particles and leaving temporary spectral burns on touched letters with CSS transform animations and WebGL particle systems
- Advanced Gesture Recognition: Multi-touch swipe patterns for spell-casting gestures, pressure-sensitive key activation using Touch Events API, mystical symbol drawing for special character input with Canvas gesture detection
- Haptic Necromancy: Device-specific vibration patterns using Navigator.vibrate() API - soft whispers (50ms) for letter selection, violent shakes (200ms) for failures, triumphant pulses (3x100ms) for success, and eerie silence during supernatural pauses
- Séance Audio Integration: Contextual Web Audio API sound layers including ancient whispers (whisper.mp3), crackling candle flames (candle.wav), distant thunder (thunder.ogg), spectral moans (ghost.mp3), and ritualistic chanting triggered by user interactions with AudioContext
- Three-Tier Digital Sorcery Challenge System: A Three-Tier Digital Sorcery Challenge System with increasing difficulty and base points.
- ACM DUBAI Exclusive Authentication System: ONLY @dubai.bits-pilani.ac.in email addresses permitted - NO EXCEPTIONS. Firebase Auth email verification + custom domain validation + academic confirmation token
- Advanced Time-Based Scoring Algorithm: Dynamic Scoring Formula: Final Score = Base Points × (300 / completion_time_seconds) × difficulty_multiplier × streak_bonus
- Comprehensive Admin Dashboard: Comprehensive dashboard for admin acm@dubai.bits-pilani.ac.in to manage users and the system.
- Firebase Security Implementation: Strict Firebase security measures to protect the system.
- Landing Page Architecture: Landing page architecture for ACM Dubai institutional branding.
- Progressive Web App Specifications: Progressive web app specifications for offline functionality.
- Anti-Cheating Security Arsenal: Anti-cheating security measures to prevent cheating.
- Initials Scraper: The system uses a tool to extract live initials from a provided URL using Puppeteer.
